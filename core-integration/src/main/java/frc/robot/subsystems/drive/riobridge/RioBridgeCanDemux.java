/**
 * The RioBridge protocol's demux/decode state: turns received {@link CANStreamMessage}s into the
 * three frame types. Deliberately has no JNI calls in it -- {@link RioBridgeCan} is the thin
 * wrapper that owns the actual CAN stream session and feeds messages in here -- so this class is
 * exercised directly in {@code RioBridgeCanDemuxTest} without a CAN session or the desktop HAL
 * sim.
 *
 * <p>{@link CANStreamMessage#timestamp}'s unit was genuinely ambiguous from the javadoc alone --
 * the field comment says milliseconds since {@code CLOCK_MONOTONIC}, {@code setStreamData}'s
 * parameter javadoc on the same class says nanoseconds -- and confirmed neither: a real
 * {@code TimestampUnitsCheck} run against real hardware measured {@code secondsPerUnit ~= 1e-6}
 * (wall-clock elapsed=1.946s against a raw timestamp delta of 1,950,175 over 40 Status frames at
 * 20 Hz), which is microseconds. {@link #TIMESTAMP_TO_SECONDS} follows that measurement, not
 * either javadoc.
 *
 * <p><b>A message can match one of the three arbitration IDs and still not be shaped like that
 * frame -- confirmed on real hardware, and confirmed systemic, not a rare edge case.</b> A live
 * run hit this on essentially every frame (a malformed count climbing by ~220/sec, matching the
 * protocol's entire combined rate, with zero Attitude samples getting through) -- not the
 * occasional bad frame the first sighting looked like. {@link #accept} drops a frame that fails
 * to unpack instead of letting the {@code IllegalArgumentException} escape and kill the whole
 * robot program (the same "don't throw out of a periodic loop" call already made below for an
 * unrecognized arbitration ID entirely), but that's damage control, not a fix -- at this rate,
 * essentially no real RioBridge data is reaching the Core. Leading hypothesis, not yet confirmed:
 * {@code TimestampUnitsCheck} -- the one piece of this whole investigation that has actually
 * worked against a real stream session -- only ever reads {@link CANStreamMessage#timestamp}; it
 * never touches {@code .data}/{@code .length}. {@link RioBridgeCan}'s session is the only code
 * path here that has ever read those two fields from a real session, and it has never once
 * succeeded. That's consistent with this WPILib build's {@code readCANStreamSession} populating
 * timestamp/messageId correctly but not marshaling the payload bytes back to Java at all -- which
 * would make this a structural blocker for the whole design (which depends on reading an 8-byte
 * payload per frame), not a per-frame nuisance. {@link #lastMalformedFrameDescription()} exists
 * to confirm or rule this out on the next run: if {@code dataLength} is consistently 0 across
 * different arbitration IDs and timestamps look sane and increasing, that's the marshaling gap;
 * if lengths vary or timestamps look wrong too, something else is going on. This is the third
 * real, hardware-found rough edge in this exact {@code readCANStreamSession} code path, after the
 * timestamp-unit ambiguity above and {@link RioBridgeCan}'s overflow-segfault.
