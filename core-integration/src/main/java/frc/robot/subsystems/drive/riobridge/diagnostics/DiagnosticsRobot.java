/**
 * A throwaway robot program for the two Core-side items in the root README's "to verify" list
 * that need a live CAN bus: timestamp units (item 1) and RX headroom under load (item 3). Not
 * part of the real Core project -- see docs/hardware-verification.md for how to deploy this in
 * place of your actual robot code for one bench session, then revert.
 *
 * <p>Runs {@link TimestampUnitsCheck} once at startup (there's no unconditional {@code
 * robotInit()} hook in the 2027 alpha's {@code IterativeRobotBase} the way there was in 2026 --
 * the constructor is the equivalent one-shot point), then continuously polls a {@link
 * RioBridgeCan} and both buses' {@link BusHealthMonitor} counters, printing a line per bus per
 * second and flagging any regression.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code attitudeFramesLastSecond} caps at ~50, not ~100, and that's correct.</b> This class
 * runs at {@code TimedRobot}'s 50 Hz default period, and {@link RioBridgeCan} has no per-sample
 * buffering (see its class javadoc) -- {@code readPacketLatest} only ever returns whichever single
 * packet is most recent at the moment of the call. Polling a 100 Hz source at 50 Hz structurally
 * cannot observe more than 50 distinct samples/sec no matter how well everything else is working;
 * confirmed on real hardware landing right at that ceiling (consistently ~50-51/sec) once the
 * payload-marshaling fix below actually worked.
 *
 * <p>{@link #rioBridgeCan} is still constructed after the steps above run, not as a field
 * initializer, matching the previous (stream-session-based) version of this class -- that
 * ordering was originally needed to avoid a real buffer-overflow crash, which doesn't apply to
 * this {@code readPacketLatest}-based implementation (see {@code RioBridgeCan}'s class javadoc:
 * there's no buffered session here to overflow), but there's no reason to reintroduce a field
 * initializer either.
