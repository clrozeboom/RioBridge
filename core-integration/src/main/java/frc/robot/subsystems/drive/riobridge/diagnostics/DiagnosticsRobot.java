/**
 * A throwaway robot program for the two Core-side items in the root README's "to verify" list
 * that need a live CAN bus: timestamp units (item 1) and RX headroom under load (item 3). Not
 * part of the real Core project -- see docs/hardware-verification.md for how to deploy this in
 * place of your actual robot code for one bench session, then revert.
 *
 * <p>Runs {@link TimestampUnitsCheck} once at startup (there's no unconditional {@code
 * robotInit()} hook in the 2027 alpha's {@code IterativeRobotBase} the way there was in 2026 --
 * the constructor is the equivalent one-shot point), then continuously polls a {@link
 * RioBridgeCan} and both buses' {@link BusHealthMonitor} counters, printing a line per bus per
 * second and flagging any regression.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #rioBridgeCan} is constructed after the steps above run, not before -- this
 * crashed the JVM on real hardware when it wasn't.</b> {@code RioBridgeCan}'s session used to be
 * a field initializer, meaning it opened (and started buffering real traffic) before
 * {@link TimestampUnitsCheck#run} even started, and that check alone took ~2.8s wall-clock on
 * real hardware while transmitting at ~220 frames/sec -- nobody was polling the session that
 * whole time, so its old 32-message buffer overflowed by roughly 20x before the first
 * {@link #robotPeriodic} call ever happened. See {@link RioBridgeCan}'s class javadoc for why
 * that overflow crashed the whole program instead of being caught. Constructing it here instead
 * means there's no gap between "session exists" and "something is polling it."
