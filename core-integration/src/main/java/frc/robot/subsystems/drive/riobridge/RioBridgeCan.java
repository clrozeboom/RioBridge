/**
 * Owns the RioBridge's single CAN stream session (README.md: "The Core reads every frame with a
 * single buffered, timestamped stream session"). Construct one per robot and share it with
 * whatever reads the encoders (see {@link #latestEncoders()}) as well as {@link
 * GyroIORioBridge} -- don't open a second session.
 *
 * <p><b>An actual buffer overflow crashes the JVM on real hardware -- confirmed, not
 * theoretical.</b> {@link #poll}'s {@code catch (CANStreamOverflowException)} below was written
 * assuming ADR-0004's "a dropped frame is fine, the protocol tolerates it" story, the same way a
 * missed UDP packet would be. That's wrong for this specific exception on this WPILib build: a
 * real overflow (an alpha-6-pinned {@code DiagnosticsRobot} left its own session unpolled for
 * ~2.8s while transmitting at ~220 frames/sec, far past its old 32-message buffer) segfaulted
 * before the catch block ever ran -- {@code SIGSEGV}, {@code SEGV_MAPERR}, address {@code 0x0},
 * inside {@code wpi::hal::ThrowCANStreamOverflowException}'s call to {@code JNIEnv_::NewObject}
 * in {@code libwpiHaljni.so}, called from {@code CANJNI.readCANStreamSession}. The native code
 * that's supposed to construct and throw this exception null-derefs instead, so nothing in Java
 * -- no try/catch here or anywhere else -- ever gets a chance to run. That makes avoiding a real
 * overflow a hard requirement, not a nice-to-have: size {@code maxMessagesPerPoll} generously
 * (comfortably above frames-per-second times the longest realistic gap between polls, not just
 * the steady-state case) and never construct a session long before you start polling it, the way
 * {@code DiagnosticsRobot} used to. {@link #overflowCount()} should read as "this never actually
 * happened," not "this happened and got handled."
 *
 * <p>The actual demux/decode logic lives in {@link RioBridgeCanDemux}, which has no JNI in it and
 * is unit tested directly. This class is the thin part that couldn't be build-verified in this
 * sandbox: there's no simulated CAN bus to open a stream session against, so neither the
 * constructor nor {@link #poll()} has run against a real HAL sim -- though the overflow crash
 * above confirms both run against a real one. See core-integration/README.md.
